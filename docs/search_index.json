"],["how-to-do-the-analysis-in-r.html", "How to do the analysis in R Data importation and Filtering", " How to do the analysis in R Data importation and Filtering Let’s explore the protected areas data! It is best to make a folder on your computer Desktop where you will work on this assignment (if needed, review Best Practices). Download the .csv file spreadsheet for protected areas in the country you are studying from the World Database on Protected Areas to the folder you made. You may rename the .csv file you downloaded eg. protected_areas.csv Open and save a new R Script your folder. One of the first commands of your R Script will be to load your data. For example: data1 &lt;- read.csv(file = &quot;protected_areas.csv&quot;) In the Console, inspect your data to check that it has loaded. For example: head(data1) If your data has not loaded, the most likely problem is a spelling error or problems with specifying the path to protected_areas.csv. You might try: the RStudio way of importing your data, or moving protected_areas.csv to your working directory. After importing the data into R, read through the metadata file that is downloaded as a pdf file along with the .csv file to better understand the data.

You may use either Approach 1: base R or Approach 2: dplyr (generally, the dplyr commands tend to be simpler, however, it is good to also know the base R commands). Approach 1: Base R To view the MARINE, column of the data in the Console, try: data1$MARINE Be sure to type exactly MARINE after the $. You need to write the column name exactly as it appear in the output of names(data1) or RStudio will produce an error. Remember MARINE is captalized in the data frame so be careful not to type Marine which will come out as an error. Approach 2: dplyr To use the dplyr functions you need to load the package (and install if you have not already done so): library(dplyr) For the MARINE, in the Console, try: select(data1, MARINE) Note that the output of select(data1, MARINE) is a data frame. We want to separate protected areas identified as exclusively terrestrial from those that include marine areas. Try this in the Console: filter(data1, MARINE == 0) To filter data that include marine areas, we run this code in the Console: data2 &lt;- filter(data1, MARINE != 0) Before computing the average size of coastal MPAs, we will need to filter the data to remove rows with null values in the REP_AREA column. Try this code in the Console data2 &lt;- filter(data2, !is.na(REP_AREA)) Now we can calculate the average size of the coastal MPAs. Let’s run this code: mean(data2$REP_AREA) The median size of the coastal MPAs can lso be found by running a similar code as follows: median(data2$REP_AREA) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
