It is best to make a folder on your computer Desktop where you will work on this assignment (if needed, review Best Practices). Download the .csv file spreadsheet for protected areas in the country you are studying from the World Database on Protected Areas to the folder you made. You may rename the .csv file you downloaded eg. protected_areas.csv Open and save a new R Script in your folder. One of the first commands of your R Script will be to load your data. For example: data1 &lt;- read.csv(file = &quot;protected_areas.csv&quot;) In the Console, inspect your data to check that it has loaded. For example: head(data1) If your data has not loaded, the most likely problem is a spelling error or problems with specifying the path to protected_areas.csv. You might try: the RStudio way of importing your data, or moving protected_areas.csv to your working directory. The working directory is the folder you created to contain your data and files. After loading the data, read through the metadata file that is downloaded as a pdf file along with the .csv file to better understand the data. Data and metadata can be found here https://www.protectedplanet.net/en/search-areas?geo_type=site We can run the following lines of code to have and understanding of what constitute the data by looking at the first six rows and the last six rows of the data. head(data1) ##

You may use either Approach 1: base R or Approach 2: dplyr (generally, the dplyr commands tend to be simpler, however, it is good to also know the base R commands). Approach 1: Base R To view the MARINE, column of the data in the Console, try: data1$MARINE Be sure to type exactly MARINE after the $. You need to write the column name exactly as it appear in the output of names(data1) or RStudio will produce an error. Remember MARINE is captalized in the data frame so be careful not to type Marine which will come out as an error. Approach 2: dplyr To use the dplyr functions you need to load the package (and install if you have not already done so): library(dplyr) Now we select the MARINE column, by typing in the source pane and running the code below: select(data1, MARINE) Note that the output of select(data1, MARINE) is a data frame. Creating a new object This section is focused on subsetting the dataset which was named as data1 and creating a new object to hold the processed data. We call this data2. We want to filter the data to separate protected areas identified as exclusively terrestrial from those that include marine areas. The new data created will be saved as data2. Let’s run this code in the Console and save it in the source pane: data2 &lt;- filter(data1, MARINE != 0) We want to compute the average size of coastal MPAs. Before we do this, we will need to filter the data to remove rows with null values in the REP_AREA column. Try this code in the Console data2 &lt;- filter(data2, !is.na(GIS_M_AREA)) Now we can calculate the average size of the coastal MPAs. Let’s run this code: mean(data2$GIS_M_AREA) The median size of the coastal MPAs can also be found by running a similar code as follows: median(data2$GIS_M_AREA) Graphing the data This section will give a brief overview of how to use graphs to understand some key concepts from the data which would be difficult to understand by just studying the raw data. You can read more on Making graphs in R First, we would like to graph the the number of areas in each level of protection. To do this, we will have to group the data according to the level of protection and count the number of areas in each level of protection and saving it as data3. Let’s do it by running this code in the Console data3 &lt;- data2 %&gt;% group_by(IUCN_CAT) %&gt;% tally() Now we delete the rows that has NAs by running this data3 &lt;- data3[-c(6, 7, 8), ] Now we can use a barplot to show the number of areas under each level of protection. The following code is able to do this barplot(data3$n, xlab = &quot;Level of protection&quot;, ylab=&quot;Number of areas&quot;, names.arg=c(&quot;Ia&quot;,&quot;Ib&quot;,&quot;II&quot;,&quot;III&quot;,&quot;IV&quot;,&quot;V&quot;,&quot;VI&quot;), las=1, main=&quot;Number of areas for each level of protection&quot;) Now we would like to calculate the amount of area that is strongly protected. We can do this by grouping by the IUCN_CAT column of the dataset and summing the GIS_M_AREA accordingly and naming the resulting data as data4. Let’s run this code in the Console data4 &lt;- data2 %&gt;% group_by(IUCN_CAT) %&gt;% summarise(AREA_SUM = sum(GIS_M_AREA)) The barplot showing the area allocations could be plotted by running this code in the Console barplot(data4$AREA_SUM, xlab = &quot;Level of protection&quot;, ylab=&quot;Area(Amt. land and water/km^2)&quot;, names.arg=c(&quot;Ia&quot;,&quot;Ib&quot;,&quot;II&quot;,&quot;III&quot;,&quot;IV&quot;, &quot;NA&quot;, &quot;NA&quot;,&quot;NR&quot; ,&quot;V&quot;, &quot;VI&quot;), las=3, main=&quot;Area of land and water for each level of protection&quot;) We would like to construct a histogram to graph the size-frequency distribution. Approach 1: base R First, we will construct a histogram without logarithm scale with the base R function hist. hist(data2$GIS_M_AREA, breaks = 50, xlab = &quot;Size of MPAs&quot;, ylab=&quot;Frequency&quot;, main = &quot;The size-frequency distribution of MPAs&quot;) # Histogram without logarithmic axis Next, we want to plot a logarithm scale histogram hist(log(data2$GIS_M_AREA), breaks = 50) # Histogram with logarithmic axis Approach 2: ggplot2 Install ggplot2 package using the install.packages() and Load the ggplot2 package using the library(). We plot a histogram with logarithmic axis by running the code below: library(ggplot2) ggplot(data.frame(log(data2$GIS_M_AREA)), aes(log(data2$GIS_M_AREA))) + geom_histogram(bins = 50) We can also plot with the scale_c_log10() function: ggplot(data.frame(data2$GIS_M_AREA), aes(data2$GIS_M_AREA)) + geom_histogram(color = &quot;blue&quot;, fill = &quot;green&quot;, bins = 50) + scale_x_log10() "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
